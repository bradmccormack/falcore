## Versioning Falcore

Falcore uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) 2.0.0.  You can find all [releases on github](https://github.com/fitstar/falcore/releases) and you can find the version history here.

We try to keep the master branch stable, however new APIs tend to change a lot until they stabilize for a release.
